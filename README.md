# CDT Ontology

CDT (Clinical Document Template) Ontology is an ontology for describing both
structural and semantics-based clinical knowledge embedded in the level of
clinical document templates. The core modeling constructs of the CDT
ontology – template description entities and their relations – are similar
to those employed in clinical data models. Its focus, however, is on
capturing the clinical purpose and intention (i.e., knowledge of
physicians' medical practice) resident in the document template, in such
a way that CDT production and consumption activities across diverse functions
in clinical organizations are supported by using the knowledge.
